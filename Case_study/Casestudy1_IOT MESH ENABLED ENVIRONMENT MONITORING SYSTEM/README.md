## ABSTRACT

 Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to play a major role in our lives through pervasive systems of sensor networks encompassing our environment. These systems are designed
monitor vital physical phenomena generating data whichcan be transmitted and saved at cloud from where this information can be accessed through applications and further actions can be taken. Building IoTs has advanced significantly in the last couple of years since it has added a new dimension to the world of information and communication technologies. The development in wireless sensor networks can be used in monitoring and controlling various parameters in the weather station field.
