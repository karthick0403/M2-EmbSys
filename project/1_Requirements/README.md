# ABSTRACT
In recent times the concepts of smart cities have become very popular. Thanks to the Internet of things the idea of smart city now seems to be completed. Consistent efforts are being made in the field of IoT in order to maximize the productivity and reliability of urban infrastructure. Problems such as, traffic congestion, limited car parking facilities and road safety are being addressed by IoT. In this paper, we present an IoT based cloud integrated smart parking system. The proposed Smart Parking system consists of an on-site deployment of an IoT module that is used to monitor and signalize the state of availability of each single parking space. A mobile application is also provided that allows an end user to check the availability of parking space and book a parking slot accordingly.

# INTRODUCTION

The concept of Internet of Things (IoT) started with things with identity communication devices. The devices could be tracked, controlled or monitored using remote computers connected through Internet. IoT extends the use of Internet providing the communication, and thus inter-network of the devices and physical objects, or ‘Things’. The scalable and robust nature of Cloud computing is allowing developers to create and host their applications on it. Cloud acts as a perfect partner for IoT as it acts as a platform where all the sensor data can be stored and accessed from remote locations. These factors gave rise to the amalgamation of both technologies thus leading to the formation of a new technology called Cloud of Things (CoT). In CoT the things (nodes) could be accessed, monitored and controlled from any remote location through the cloud. Due to high scalability in cloud any number of node could be added or Removed from the IoT system on a real time basis. 
In simple terms IoT can be explained in form of an equation stating: Physical Object + Controller, Sensor and Actuators + Internet = Internet of Things
  
Recent advances in creating low-cost, low-power embedded systems are helping developers to build new applications for Internet of Things. Followed by the developments in sensor technology, many modern cities have opted for deploying various IoT based systems in and around the cities for the purpose of monitoring. A recent survey performed by the International Parking Institute reflects an increase in number of innovative ideas related to parking systems. At present there are certain parking systems that claim to citizens of delivering real time information about, available parking spaces. Such systems require efficient sensors to be deployed in the parking areas for monitoring the occupancy as well as quick data processing units in order to gain practical insights from data collected over various sources.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Parking management influences drivers search time and cost for parking spaces. It may also cause traffic congestion.  Finding a parking space in most metropolitan areas, especially during the rush hours, is difficult for drivers. Difficulty arises from not knowing where the available spaces may be at that time traffic congestion may occur.



## SOLUTION

Parking space reservation can help drivers to reduce the search time dramatically. With the real-time reservation service, the drivers can find and reserve their desired vacant parking spaces quickly. Therefore, the gasoline and time in search of vacant parking space is reduced.  It reduces time in search of vacant parking spaces is reduced so it reduces traffic congestion caused due that.

## REQUIREMENT
 
⦁	Power Supply - Power supply gives 5v supply to the PIC microcontroller and other block also work on 5v DC.  
⦁	IR Sensor - The IR sensor used to detect the car in parking. If car is present then it shows on cloud as that parking slot is allowed if not allowed then it will shows that parking slot empty. 
⦁	Reservation - if you booked parking then from booking time then it will be booked for next 5 minutes and countdown start at timer. 
⦁	Buzzer - If any other person parked their car in booked slot then alarm will get buzzed periodically for some time as per set.
⦁	LED - On LED we will show the indication of booked slot. 
⦁	LCD - LCD part is used in security area for check out the parking is allotted or free.
