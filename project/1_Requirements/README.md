# ABSTRACT
Being born with disabilities is a common thing nowadays. But only the person having the disability has to endure the pain and sufferings caused by it. One of the disabilities among those is blindness. It's hard for blind people to do any work by themselves. Also itâ€™s definitely not easy for them to identify the currency notes. And the basic idea of this project is to make it possible for them to identify currency notes easily. This is made possible with just a simple Arduino board basedon ATmega328P, UV LED and a TCS320color Sensor. ATMEGA328P is an 8- bit microcontroller based on AVR RISC architecture. UV LED helps to identify the legitimacy of the currency notes. Thecolor sensor identifies the color of the currency notes and sends it to the microcontroller which identifies whether it is a two thousand or five hundred rupee note etc. The detected color is read out loud via a speaker or an earphone as its respective currency value. This is the first ever smart wallet using Arduino and a color sensor. This is very easy to build and information about the total money taken out from the wallet can be sent to mobile phones if needed.

# INTRODUCTION

## GENERAL
Recognition of things is the most difficult task a blind person goes through. Especially in the identification of currency notes itâ€™s very true. Normally a blind person has two most important difficulties while identifying a currency note. First the person needs to know the legitimacy of the note and second they need to identify its value. Usually a blind person identifies the legitimacy of the currency note using the raised printing of the Mahatma Gandhi portrait and the Ashoka Pillar emblem on the right side of the currency note. Also there are different shapes toidentify the value of the notes with some raised lines on the right side of the note. There are also braille markings on the side of the currency notes. But these markings tend to fade away in due course of time. In case if the person is not able to differentiate the value using the shapes and the lines, this methodcan be a life saver. This method is implemented using embedded systems, which can simply be understood as software embedded on a hardware device. Microcontrollers are a part
of this embedded system. They are like a small computer on a single IC chip. Arduino is an open source electronic platform which is an easy to use hardware and software.It is less expensive when compared to other microcontrollers and works on nearly every operating system. They are easy to code and open source. They require only 5V of power to operate. They also have both analog and digital inputs. It is the most popular Arduino.

# AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT

ï‚· Using a microcontroller to design and develop a prototype of a smart walletwhich
helps blind people to identify the Indian currency notes.
ï‚· Facilitating easy identification of currency notes by blind people.
ï‚· Identifying the legitimacy of currency notes.
ï‚· Providing an easy identification of the denomination or value of the currency notes
for the blind people.
ï‚· Implementing a theft alert system which sends an alert message in case of
emergency

# SCOPE OF THE WORK
ðŸž„ India has an estimated number of 12 million blind people from 2000 to 2020.
According to the above data, India has around one-third blind people among the
worldâ€™s blind population. In a rapidly developing country like India, money is of
much importance. It is even more important to the blind people than anybody else.
ðŸž„ Even though there are intaglio markings on the notes that can be detected by
touching, these markings can fade away during the course of time. Also, the shapes
and lines in the notes are not easily identifiable by everyone. This comes in
handy during such cases and it is precise and user friendly as it reads the values of
the currency notes through a speaker or an earphone.
ðŸž„ It is portable, affordable, time saving and consumes less energy and would be easily
available to everyone everywhere. In future this can be enhanced sothat it makes a
calculation of money spent per day and can be sent as SMS tomobile phones.
ðŸž„ Microcontrollers are optimized to perform a dedicated low-power application and
ideal for embedded systems. Microcontroller projects are very easy touse and
maintenance is very simple.
